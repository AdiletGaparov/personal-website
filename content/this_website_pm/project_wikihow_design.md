**Design**

The way I designed this personal website was formed by 3 considerations:    
1. Design should be aligned with both my analytical personality and background in data science.    
2. I should be able to implement it by myself without spending too much time on learning extra technologies (front-end).        
3. It should still bring some challenge and be of decent quality. 
        
Having said, I decided to design it as an analytical web app / dashboard, which shows the information about me, instead of a business. 
        
Some thoughts about the design specifics:    
1. I tried to follow the color scheme and font, used by creators of Streamlit, the library I used to implement this website. However, in the Gantt chart about my experience (Resume), I specifically used the following colors:  
<ul>    
<li><span style='color:green; background-color: green'>Col</span> Green to describe educational experiences as it symbolizes renewal and youth.</li>
<li><span style='color:blue; background-color: blue'>Col</span> Blue to describe my full-time jobs and job-related travels as it symbolizes stability and often used by tech companies.</li>
<li><span style='color:red; background-color: red'>Col</span> Red to describe my freelance job and regular travels as it symbolizes energy and passion.</li>
<li><span style='color:yellow; background-color: yellow'>Col</span> Yellow to describe key personal moments as it symbolizes joy and happiness.</li>
</ul>    
2. I decided to implement voice feature ('How to pronounce my name') after having seen it (about the same time) on LinkedIn and on <a href="https://inakisoria.com/" target="_blank">a web designer's personal page</a>. It is indeed an issue I faced a lot of time while being abroad.
