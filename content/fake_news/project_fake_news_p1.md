In this project, I am going to use CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining [(CRISP-DM methodology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining).

Fake News Detection is quite popular problem nowadays. There is no doubt that it is very complex problem, because we see that even major platforms can't efficiently stop the spread of fake news, hiring many people, deploying sophisticated policies and models.
For example, few years ago Twitter acquired startup Fabula AI, that has developed a technology to detect the fake information using graph-based approach, analyzing the differences in the way fake and real information spread across the network. 
Another (simpler) approach would be to analyze the difference in the choice of words used in both fake and real news. And this is what I did.
