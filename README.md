# First version of my personal website

I built it during summer 2020 using Streamlit. It was initially hosted on Heroku in a Docker container, but once I rebuilt my website in React, I deleted it. It should be available via (free) Streamlit Share (https://share.streamlit.io/adiletgaparov/personal-website/app.py).
