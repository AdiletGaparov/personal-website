**Individual project for Natural Language Processing (NLP) class at IE**

In this project, I tried to use several NLP concepts and Machine Learning models to solve quite popular problem nowadays: Fake News Detection. 
There is no doubt that *fake news detection* is very complex problem, we see that even major platforms can't efficiently stop the spread of *fake news*, hiring many people, deploying sophisticated policies and models.
For example, few years ago Twitter acquired startup Fabula AI, that has developed a technology to detect the fake information using graph-based approach, analyzing the differences in the way fake and real information spread across the network. 
 
Having said that, my solution here is based on the choice of words used in both fake and real news, which requires some application of NLP concepts and Machine Learning. 
For your curiosity, you can try to test my final model on the navigation panel under Tech Demo (left). The full code is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AdiletGaparov/mbd-natural-language-processing/tree/master/fake-news-detection).
